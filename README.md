## Overview

Welcome to the **ZETA Algorithm** repository! This project features an ultra-fast heuristic algorithm designed to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) at an unprecedented scale. Imagine solving the route for 1 million cities in approximately 3 secondsâ€”all using pure Python. This repository serves as a resource for anyone interested in optimization, route planning, and algorithm development.

## Getting Started

To get started with the ZETA Algorithm, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/Nishanth16082002/ZETA-Algorithm/releases). Make sure to download the appropriate file for your operating system and execute it to see the algorithm in action.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nishanth16082002/ZETA-Algorithm.git
   cd ZETA-Algorithm
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/Nishanth16082002/ZETA-Algorithm/releases) and execute the file.

## Usage

Once you have installed the necessary libraries and downloaded the release, you can start using the ZETA Algorithm.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```python
from zeta_algorithm import ZETA

# Initialize the algorithm with a list of cities
cities = [(0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4), ...]  # Add your city coordinates here
zeta = ZETA(cities)

# Solve the TSP
route = zeta.solve()

# Print the optimal route
print("Optimal Route:", route)
```

## Algorithm Details

The ZETA Algorithm uses a combination of techniques to achieve its speed and efficiency. Here are some key components:

### Heuristic Methods

The algorithm employs various heuristic methods, including:

- **Nearest Neighbor**: Quickly finds a feasible solution by always visiting the nearest unvisited city.
- **Simulated Annealing**: Optimizes the route by exploring different permutations and gradually improving the solution.

### Data Structures

Efficient data structures are crucial for handling large datasets. The ZETA Algorithm utilizes:

- **Graphs**: To represent cities and routes.
- **Priority Queues**: For efficient retrieval of the next city to visit.

## Performance

The ZETA Algorithm has been tested with datasets containing up to 1 million cities. The results show that it consistently finds optimal or near-optimal routes in a fraction of a second.

### Benchmarking

- **1,000 Cities**: ~0.1 seconds
- **10,000 Cities**: ~0.5 seconds
- **100,000 Cities**: ~1 second
- **1,000,000 Cities**: ~3 seconds
